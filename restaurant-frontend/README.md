# DESCRIPTION

## Project objective: 

Build a responsive website for a restaurant where users can read the details of the restaurant.’


### Background of the problem statement: 

You are a web developer at a service-based web development company called Kite Technologies. The company has been approached by a client who wants to build a website for their restaurant named Ming’s Diner. The website should provide the users a brief overview of the restaurant and its bestsellers, its address, as well as an option to contact the restaurant. During sprint planning, you agree to lead this project and develop the website. 

The focus of this project is largely on the *Visual* elements of the application and that should be your primary focus.  Business logic should only exist to the extent that it supports
visual experience for the user.


### The tasks you are responsible for: 

● Building the website using HTML

● Adding Bootstrap to the website

● Adding a landing page, a navbar, a CTA button, a grid, and a footer

● Adding a contact form for users to contact the restaurant

● Pushing the code to the git repository


### You can use the following tools: 

● HTML: To define the content of the website

● Bootstrap: To build the website (this is required)

● JavaScript (Optional): To handle events and responses

● JQuery (Optional): To include JavaScript plugins like modals, tooltips, etc.   (Use of JQuery beyond that portion used for bootstrap is optional.)


### The following requirements should be met:

 * The text content is unimportant and lorem ipsum is acceptable.
 * There is no no need for sever-side code in the assigment.  
 * The website should be responsive.
 * The website should have a carousel, a navbar, a CTA button, a boostrap grid (as a page layout function), and a footer. 
 * The website should have a contact form. (which doesn't need to actually do anything other than confirm that the contact details have been submitted.)
 * The CTA (Call To Action) button's functionality can simply lead to another page on the site such as ordering, menu, or contact.  (Preferably order or menu)
 * The focus of this project should be visual and so application functionality such as contact form, order page, etc should have only the minimum business logic to support the visual aspects of the page.
 * Form submittals such as contact or order don't need to do anything beyond giving visual cues to the user that hte form had been submitted.
 * There is no need to store any data or allow user to query prior orders and/or contact details.
 * The source code should be pushed to your GitHub repositories. You need to document the steps and write the algorithms in the Google Docs.
 * The link of your GitHub repository is must. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository. You can add a section in the Google Docs. 
 * Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task.
