# Handling User Authentication .
## DESCRIPTION


## Project objective:

Set up a standalone project to do unit testing of the user authentication class which is used in the main web application. The objective is to create a JUnit class that will test all aspects of the authentication class.


## Background of the problem statement:

As a part of developing an ecommerce web application, a test-suite is being created to do unit testing of all backend components in the web application. This project will test the user authentication class. This project will be a standalone Java application, since Junit does not directly test servlets or web pages. We are only testing the classes that have the business logic.


You must use the following:

● Eclipse as the IDE

● Apache Tomcat as the web server

● Junit 5



Following requirements should be met:

● Create a standalone Java application using Maven

● Create an authentication class that has all the methods related to user authentication

● Create a JUnit test class to create unit tests for the authentication class

● Run the test class directly as a JUnit and check if all the tests pass

● Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task
